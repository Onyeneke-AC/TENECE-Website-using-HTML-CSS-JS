# TENECE-Website-using-HTML-CSS-JS
Use of HTML, CSS & JavaScript to re-build the website of a firm which was initially built using wordpress.

The purpose of this project was to ensure that my knowledge and foundation of CSS and HTML were strong enough before I dive fully into the use of react js.

I had already followed a step by step procedure to building a website making use of react but I had issues building one on my own.

When I traced out what the major problem was, I realized that my foundation on HTML and CSS weren't strong enough hence I needed to work on those and that was the purpose of this project.
